  abstract = {When listening in noisy and reverberant environments, human listeners are able to focus on a particular sound of interest while ignoring interfering sounds. Computer listeners, however, can only perform highly constrained versions of this task. While automatic speech recognition systems and hearing aids work well in quiet conditions, source separation is necessary for them to be able to function in these challenging situations.

This dissertation introduces a system that separates more than two sound sources from reverberant, binaural mixtures based on the sources' locations. Each source is modelled probabilistically using information about its interaural time and level differences at every frequency, with parameters learned using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The system is therefore called Model-based EM Source Separation and Localization (MESSL). This EM algorithm alternates between refining its estimates of the model parameters (location) for each source and refining its estimates of the regions of the spectrogram dominated by each source. In addition to successfully separating sources, the algorithm estimates model parameters from a mixture that have direct psychoacoustic relevance and can usually only be measured for isolated sources. One of the key features enabling this separation is a novel probabilistic localization model that can be evaluated at individual time-frequency points and over arbitrarily-shaped regions of the spectrogram.

The localization performance of the systems introduced here is comparable to that of humans in both anechoic and reverberant conditions, with a 40\% lower mean absolute error than four comparable algorithms. When target and masker sources are mixed at similar levels, MESSL's separations have signal-to-distortion ratios 2.0 dB higher than four comparable separation algorithms and estimated speech quality 0.19 mean opinion score units higher. When target and masker sources are mixed anechoically at very different levels, MESSL's performance is comparable to humans', but in similar reverberant mixtures it only achieves 20–-25\% of human performance. While MESSL successfully rejects enough of the direct-path portion of the masking source in reverberant mixtures to improve energy-based signal-to-noise ratio results, it has difficulty rejecting enough reverberation to improve automatic speech recognition results significantly. This problem is shared by other comparable separation systems.}

  abstract = {Listeners can reliably perceive speech in noisy conditions, but it is not well understood what specific features of speech they use to do this. This paper introduces a data-driven framework to identify the time-frequency locations of these features. Using the same speech utterance mixed with many different noise instances, the framework is able to compute the importance of each time-frequency point in the utterance to its intelligibility. The mixtures have approximately the same global signal-to-noise ratio at each frequency, but very different recognition rates. The difference between these intelligible vs unintelligible mixtures is the alignment between the speech and spectro-temporally modulated noise, providing different combinations of “glimpses” of speech in each mixture. The current results reveal the locations of these important noise-robust phonetic features in a restricted set of syllables. Classification models trained to predict whether individual mixtures are intelligible based on the location of these glimpses can generalize to new conditions, successfully predicting the intelligibility of novel mixtures. They are able to generalize to novel noise instances, novel productions of the same word by the same talker, novel utterances of the same word spoken by different talkers, and, to some extent, novel consonants.},

  abstract = {Recent developments have demonstrated the capacity of restricted
Boltzmann machines (RBM) to be powerful generative models, able to
extract useful features from input data or construct deep artificial
neural networks. In such settings, the RBM only yields a preprocessing
or an initialization for some other model, instead of acting as a
complete supervised model in its own right. In this paper, we argue
that RBMs can provide a self-contained framework for developing
competitive classifiers. We study the Classification RBM (ClassRBM), a
variant on the RBM adapted to the classification setting. We study
different strategies for training the ClassRBM and show that
competitive classification performances can be reached when
appropriately combining discriminative and generative training
objectives. Since training according to the generative objective
requires the computation of a generally intractable gradient, we also
compare different approaches to estimating this gradient and address
the issue of obtaining such a gradient for problems with very high
dimensional inputs. Finally, we describe how to adapt the ClassRBM to
two special cases of classification problems, namely semi-supervised
and multitask learning.}

  abstract = {We describe a system for separating multiple sources from a two-channel recording based on interaural cues and prior knowledge of the statistics of the underlying source signals. The proposed algorithm effectively combines information derived from low level perceptual cues, similar to those used by the human auditory system, with higher level information related to speaker identity. We combine a probabilistic model of the observed interaural level and phase differences with a prior model of the source statistics and derive an EM algorithm for finding the maximum likelihood parameters of the joint model. The system is able to separate more sound sources than there are observed channels in the presence of reverberation. In simulated mixtures of speech from two and three speakers the proposed algorithm gives a signal-to-noise ratio improvement of 1.7 dB over a baseline algorithm which uses only interaural cues. Further improvement is obtained by incorporating eigenvoice speaker adaptation to enable the source model to better match the sources present in the signal. This improves performance over the baseline by 2.7 dB when the speakers used for training and testing are matched. However, the improvement is minimal when the test data is very different from that used in training.}

systems on a speech separation task for which human intelligibility
has previously been measured.  For anechoic mixtures, automatic speech
recognition (ASR) performance on the separated signals is quite
similar to human performance.  In reverberation, however, while signal
separation has some benefit for ASR, the results are still far below
those of human listeners facing the same task.  Performing this same
experiment with a number of oracle masks created with \emph{a priori}
knowledge of the separated sources motivates a new objective measure
of separation performance, the DERTM (Direct-path, Early echo, and
Reverberation, of the Target and Masker), which is closely related to
the ASR results.  This measure indicates that while the non-oracle
algorithms successfully reject the direct-path signal from the masking
source, they reject less of its reverberation, explaining the
disappointing ASR performance.}

  abstract = {This paper describes a system, referred to as model-based expectation-maximization source separation and localization (MESSL), for separating and localizing multiple sound sources from an underdetermined reverberant two-channel recording. By clustering individual spectrogram points based on their interaural phase and level differences, MESSL generates masks that can be used to isolate individual sound sources. We first describe a probabilistic model of interaural parameters that can be evaluated at individual spectrogram points. By creating a mixture of these models over sources and delays, the multi-source localization problem is reduced to a collection of single source problems. We derive an expectation-maximization algorithm for computing the maximum-likelihood parameters of this mixture model, and show that these parameters correspond well with interaural parameters measured in isolation. As a byproduct of fitting this mixture model, the algorithm creates probabilistic spectrogram masks that can be used for source separation. In simulated anechoic and reverberant environments, separations using MESSL produced on average a signal-to-distortion ratio 1.6 dB greater and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) results 0.27 mean opinion score units greater than four comparable algorithms.}

Finally, we give insight into the future of this growing field and how it fits into the larger context of multimedia information retrieval.}

  abstract = {Traditional noise reduction systems modify a noisy signal to make it more like the original clean signal. For speech, these methods suffer from two main problems: under-suppression of noise and over-suppression of target speech. Instead, synthesizing clean speech based on the noisy signal could produce outputs that are both noise-free and high quality.  Our previous work introduced such a system using concatenative synthesis, but it required processing the clean speech at run time, which was slow and not scalable. In order to make such a system scalable, we propose here learning a similarity metric using two separate networks, one network processing the clean segments offline and another processing the noisy segments at run time. This system incorporates a ranking loss to optimize for the retrieval of appropriate clean speech segments. This model is compared against our original on the CHiME2-GRID corpus, measuring ranking performance and subjective listening tests of resyntheses.}

We expand on this to investigate what happens with larger selections and fewer constraints on language modeling data.  Our results, on four languages from the final BABEL OP3 period, show that active learning is helpful at larger selections with consistent gains up to 14 hours. We also find that the impact of additional language model data is orthogonal to the impact of the active learning selection criteria.}

This paper evaluates a new score-guided approach to f0 and power estimation in polyphonic audio and compares the use of four different input features: the central bin frequencies of the spectrogram, the instantaneous frequency, and two variants of a high resolution spectral analysis. These four features were evaluated on four-part multi-track ensemble recordings, consisting of either four vocalists or bassoon, clarinet, saxophone, and violin (the Bach10 data set) created from polyphonic mixes of the monophonic tracks both with and without artificial reverberation. Score information was used to identify time-frequency regions of interest in the polyphonic mixes for each note in a corresponding aligned score, from which f0 and power estimates were made. The approach was able to recover ground truth f0 within 20 cents on average in reverberation and power within 5\,dB for anechoic mixtures, but only within 10\,dB for reverberant.

This paper proposes an unsupervised spatial clustering approach to microphone array processing that can overcome such train-test mismatches.  This approach, known as Model-based EM Source Separation and Localization (MESSL), clusters spectrogram points based on the relative differences in phase and level between pairs of microphones.  Here it is used for the first time to drive minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming in several ways.  We compare it to a standard delay-and-sum beamformer on the CHiME-3 noisy test set (real recordings), using each system as a pre-processor for the same recognizer trained on the AMI meeting corpus.

These sentences were mixed with ``bubble'' noise, which is designed to reveal randomly selected time-frequency glimpses of the sentence.  Responses to these noisy mixtures allowed the identification of time-frequency regions that were important for each listener to recognize each sentence, i.e., regions that were frequently audible when a sentence was correctly identified and inaudible when it was not.  In comparing these regions across human and machine listeners, we found that dips in noise allowed the humans to recognize words based on informative speech cues.  In contrast, the baseline CHiME-2-GRID recognizer correctly identified sentences only when the time-frequency profile of the noisy mixture matched that of the underlying speech.}

  abstract = {Recent studies on multi-microphone speech databases indicate
that it is beneficial to perform beamforming to improve speech
recognition accuracies, especially when there is a high level of
background noise. Minimum variance distortionless response
(MVDR) beamforming is an important beamforming method
that performs quite well for speech recognition purposes especially
if the steering vector is known. However, steering the
beamformer to focus on speech in unknown acoustic conditions
remains a challenging problem. In this study, we use single-channel
speech enhancement deep networks to form masks that
can be used for noise spatial covariance estimation, which steers
the MVDR beamforming toward the speech. We analyze how
mask prediction affects performance and also discuss various
ways to use masks to obtain the speech and noise spatial covariance
estimates in a reliable way. We show that using a
single mask across microphones for covariance prediction with
minima-limited post-masking yields the best result in terms of
signal-level quality measures and speech recognition word error
rates in a mismatched training condition.}

  abstract = {Despite the significant progress in speech recognition enabled by deep neural networks, poor performance persists in some scenarios. In this work, we focus on far-field speech recognition which remains challenging due to high levels of noise and reverberation in the captured speech signals. We propose to represent the stages of acoustic processing including beamforming, feature extraction, and acoustic modeling, as three components of a single unified computational network. The parameters of a frequency-domain beamformer are first estimated by a network based on features derived from the microphone channels. These filter coefficients are then applied to the array signals to form an enhanced signal. Conventional features are then extracted from this signal and passed to a second network that performs acoustic modeling for classification. The parameters of both the beamforming and acoustic modeling networks are trained jointly using back-propagation with a common crossentropy objective function. In experiments on the AMI meeting corpus, we observed improvements by pre-training each sub-network with a network-specific objective function before joint training of both networks. The proposed method obtained a 3.2\% absolute word error rate reduction compared to a conventional pipeline of independent processing stages.}

  abstract = {Automatic Speech Recognition systems suffer from severe performance degradation in the presence of myriad complicating factors such as noise, reverberation, multiple speech sources, multiple recording devices, etc.  Previous challenges have sparked much innovation when it comes to designing systems capable of handling these complications.  In this spirit, the CHiME-3 challenge presents system builders with the task of recognizing speech in a real-world noisy setting wherein speakers talk to an array of 6 microphones in a tablet.  In order to address these issues, we explore the effectiveness of first applying a model-based source separation mask  to the output of a beamformer that combines the source signals recorded by each microphone, followed by a DNN-based front end spectral mapper that predicts clean filterbank features.  The source separation algorithm MESSL (Model-based EM Source Separation and Localization) has been extended from two channels to multiple channels in order to meet the demands of the challenge.  We report on interactions between the two systems, cross-cut by the use of a robust beamforming algorithm called BeamformIt.   Evaluations of different system settings reveal that combining MESSL and the spectral mapper together on the baseline beamformer algorithm boosts the performance substantially.

Such a resynthesis should have little noise and high quality compared to mask-based approaches. We compare several different excitation signals on the Aurora4 corpus, including those derived from the high quefrency components of the noisy mixture and from the combination of a noise robust pitch tracker and a voiced/unvoiced classifier.

                  algorithm is one such approach for binaural signals

We utilize a recently introduced data-driven framework to identify these features.  By analyzing listening-test results involving the same speech utterance mixed with many different noise instances, the framework is able to compute the importance of each time-frequency point in the utterance to its intelligibility.  This paper shows that a trained model resulting from this framework can generalize to new conditions, successfully predicting the intelligibility of novel mixtures. First, it can generalize to novel noise instances after being trained on mixtures involving the same speech utterance but different noises. Second, it can generalize to novel talkers after being trained on mixtures involving the same syllables produced by different talkers in different noises. Finally, it can generalize to novel phonemes, after being trained on mixtures involving different consonants produced by the same or different talkers in different noises. Aligning the clean utterances in time and then propagating this alignment to the features used in the intelligibility prediction improves this generalization performance further.}

It is not clear, however, how best to combine spectral masking with the non-linear processing necessary to compute automatic speech recognition features. We propose an analysis-by-synthesis approach to automatic speech recognition, which, given a spectral mask, poses the estimation of mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) of the clean speech as an optimization problem. MFCCs are found that minimize a combination of the distance from the resynthesized clean power spectrum to the regions of the noisy spectrum selected by the mask and the negative log likelihood under an unmodified large vocabulary continuous speech recognizer. In evaluations on the Aurora4 noisy speech recognition task with both ideal and estimated masks, analysis-by-synthesis decreases both word error rates and distances to clean speech as compared to traditional approaches.}

The analysis learns a map of the importance of each point in the recording's spectrogram to the overall intelligibility of the word when glimpsed through ``bubbles'' in many noise instances.  By treating this as a classification problem, a linear classifier can be used to predict intelligibility and can be examined to determine the importance of spectral regions.

  booktitle = {Proceedings of Interspeech},
  abstract = {Reverberation has a detrimental effect on speech perception both in terms of quality as well as intelligibility, as late reflections smear temporal and spectral cues. The ideal binary mask, which is an established computational approach to sound separation, was recently extended to remove reverberation. Experiments with both normal hearing and hearing impaired listeners have shown significant intelligibility improvements for reverberant speech processed using such a priori binary masks. The dereverberation problem can thus be formulated as a classification problem, where the desired output is the ideal binary mask. The goal in this approach is to produce a mask that selects the time-frequency regions where the direct energy dominates the energy from the late reflections. In this study, a binaural dereverberation algorithm is proposed which utilizes the binaural cues of interaural time and level differences as features. The algorithm is tested in highly reverberant environments using both simulated and recorded room impulse responses. Evaluations show significant improvements over the unprocessed condition as measured by both a speech quality measure and a speech intelligibility predictor.}

  abstract = {This paper describes a technique to improve the accuracy of dynamic time warping-based MIDI-audio alignment. The technique implements a hidden Markov model that uses aperiodicity and power estimates from the signal as observations and the results of a dynamic time warping alignment as a prior. In addition to improving the overall alignment, this technique also identifies the transient and steady state sections of the note. This information is important for describing various aspects of a musical performance, including both pitch and rhythm.}

The conventional way to evaluate audio tagging algorithms is to compute measures of agreement between the output and the ground truth set. In this work, we introduce a new method for evaluating audio tagging algorithms on a large scale by collecting set-level judgments from players of a human computation game called TagATune. We present the design and preliminary results of an experiment comparing five algorithms using this new evaluation metric, and contrast the results with those obtained by applying several conventional agreement-based evaluation metrics.}

This paper describes a new system, tested on the task of artist identification, that uses support vector machines to classify songs based on features calculated over their entire lengths.  Since support vector machines are exemplar-based classifiers, training on and classifying entire songs instead of short-time features makes intuitive sense.  On a dataset of 1200 pop songs performed by 18 artists, we show that this classifier outperforms similar classifiers that use only SVMs or song-level features.  We also show that the KL divergence between single Gaussians and Mahalanobis distance between MFCC statistics vectors perform comparably when classifiers are trained and tested on separate albums, but KL divergence outperforms Mahalanobis distance when trained and tested on songs from the same albums.}

  abstract = {We describe a three­dimensional geometric hand model suitable for visual tracking applications. The kinematic constraints implied by the model's joints have a probabilistic structure which is well described by a graphical model. Inference in this model is complicated by the hand's many degrees of freedom, as well as multimodal likelihoods caused by ambiguous image measurements. We use nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) to develop a tracking algorithm which exploits the graph's structure to control complexity, while avoiding costly discretization. While kinematic constraints naturally have a local structure, self­ occlusions created by the imaging process lead to complex interpendencies in color and edge­based likelihood functions. However, we show that local structure may be recovered by introducing binary hidden variables describing the occlusion state of each pixel. We augment the NBP algorithm to infer these occlusion variables in a distributed fashion, and then analytically marginalize over them to produce hand position estimates which properly account for occlusion events. We provide simulations showing that NBP may be used to refine inaccurate model initializations, as well as track hand motion through extended image sequences. }

  abstract = {Listeners can reliably identify speech in noisy conditions, but it is not well understood which specific features of speech they use to do this.  This talk presents a data-driven framework for identifying these features.  By analyzing listening-test results involving the same speech utterance mixed with many different "bubble" noise instances, the framework is able to compute the importance of each time-frequency point in the utterance to its intelligibility, which we call the time-frequency importance function.  We show that listeners are self-consistent in their ability to identify the word in individual mixtures and are also fairly consistent with other listeners, and that different listeners' time-frequency importance functions are similar for the same utterance.  In addition, a predictive model trained under this framework is able to generalize to new conditions, successfully predicting the intelligibility of mixtures involving novel noise instances, novel utterances of the same word from the same and different talkers, and even to some extent novel consonants.  If there is time, I will also discuss a preliminary experiment applying this framework to the determination of the time-frequency points in a musical note that are most important to listeners for recognizing its timbre.

been performed over console-oriented conversational
interfaces using query languages such as SQL. With the
rise in popularity of gestural user interfaces and
computing devices that use gestures as their exclusive
mode of interaction, database query interfaces require a
fundamental rethinking to work without keyboards. Unlike
domain-specific applications, the scope of possible actions
is significantly larger if not infinite. Thus, the recognition
of gestures and their consequent queries is a challenge.
We present a novel gesture recognition system that uses
both the interaction and the state of the database to
classify gestural input into relational database queries.
Preliminary results show that using this approach allows
for fast, efficient and interactive gesture-based querying
over relational databases.}

training a {CRBM} to predict tags that a user would apply to a clip of a song

between tags, this model is able to pre-process training data to significantly
improve the performance of a support vector machine ({SVM}) autotagging. The
second is the use of a discriminative {RBM}, a type of {CRBM}, to autotag music. By
simultaneously exploiting the relationships among tags and between tags and
audio-based features, this model is able to significantly outperform {SVMs},
logistic regression, and multi-layer perceptrons. In order to be applied to
this problem, the discriminative {RBM} was generalized to the multi-label setting
and four different learning algorithms for it were evaluated, the first such

  abstract = {This paper develops probabilistic methods for visual tracking of a three-dimensional geometric hand model from monocular image sequences. We consider a redundant representation in which each model component is described by its position and orientation in the world coordinate frame. A prior model is then defined which enforces the kinematic constraints implied by the model's joints. We show that this prior has a local structure, and is in fact a pairwise Markov random field. Furthermore, our redundant representation allows color and edge-based likelihood measures, such as the Chamfer distance, to be similarly decomposed in cases where there is no self-occlusion. Given this graphical model of hand kinematics, we may track the hand's motion using the recently proposed nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) algorithm. Like particle filters, NBP approximates the posterior distribution over hand configurations as a collection of samples. However, NBP uses the graphical structure to greatly reduce the dimensionality of these distributions, providing improved robustness. Several methods are used to improve NBP's computational efficiency, including a novel KD-tree based method for fast Chamfer distance evaluation. We provide simulations showing that NBP may be used to refine inaccurate model initializations, as well as track hand motion through extended image sequences.}
