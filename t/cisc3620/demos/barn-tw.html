<h1>Barn Demo</h1>

<p>This file has the minimal code to create a working Three.js
  application, using the TW object to set up the camera for us.
  Because the canvas does not cover the entire window, there is space for
  some ordinary HTML like this.

<div style="width: 40%; float: left">
<h2>GUI</h2>

<p>The <code>TW.cameraSetup()</code> method sets up a THREE.js Orbiting Camera
  (we'll learn more about this later) that lets you look at the scene
  from all sides.  You'll find it's pretty intuitive, but here's a brief
  listing of what the mouse will do:
  <ul>
    <li>Clicking and dragging the mouse on the canvas moves the camera around the 
    center of the scene, <em>orbiting</em> it. For example, clicking and dragging 
    from left to right lets you look at all the walls of the barn, and dragging 
    up and down lets you see the roof and floor.
    <li>The arrow keys can be used to shift the camera to the left, right, up, or
    down. Dragging the mouse then rotates the barn around a different point.
    <li>The scroll wheel allows you to <q>dolly</q> the camera in
    (closer to the center of the scene) or out (farther away).
  </ul>

<p>Later we'll learn how to modify the GUI to do different actions.

<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

<p>The <code>TW.cameraSetup()</code> method also sets up some keyboard
  commands. Enter "?" to find out what they are.
  You may need to click on the canvas first, to put it in focus.

// We always need a scene

var scene = new THREE.Scene();

// ====================================================================

/* Next, we create objects in our scene. Here, the <q>classic</q>
barn. The front left bottom vertex of the barn is the origin, so, for
example, the x coordinates go from 0 to 20. */

var barnWidth = 20;
var barnHeight = 30;
var barnDepth = 40;

var barnGeometry = TW.createBarn( barnWidth, barnHeight, barnDepth );

// the createMesh function adds a "demo" material to the geometry

var barnMesh = TW.createMesh( barnGeometry );

// the scene is the set of things to render, so add the barn

scene.add(barnMesh);

// ================================================================

// We always need a renderer

var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

TW.mainInit(renderer,scene);

/* We always need a camera; here we'll use a default orbiting camera.  The
third argument gives the ranges for the coordinates, to help with setting up
the placement of the camera. They need not be perfectly accurate, but if
they are way off, your camera might not see anything, and you'll get a
blank canvas. */

TW.cameraSetup(renderer,
               scene,
               {minx: 0, maxx: barnWidth,
                miny: 0, maxy: barnHeight, // a bit low
                minz: -barnDepth, maxz: 0});
